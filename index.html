                        losing vision a grieving
                        Wanda Maximoff unleashed a surge of chaos magic that dispersed a massive energy field

                        to disclose Anomaly. The dissolution of the Anomaly meant that Wanda Maximoff's chaos magic

                        Tommy, Billy, and their house — could no longer continue to exist. And she had to sacrifice her

        <h1>Power and Uniqueness of <span class="witch-color">Wanda Maximoff</span></h1>
        <ul class="witch-color">
            <li>Psionics: <span class="black">As a result of exposure to the cosmic energies from the Scepter,
                    which contained the Mind Stone, Maximoff gained an array of psionic powers.</span></li>
            <li>Psychic Energy Manipulation: <span class="black">Maximoff can project energy blasts, streams, waves and
                    bolts of her own psionic and telekinetic energy, allowing her to strike, push, pull or blow away her
                    targets,</span></li>
            <li>Disintegration: <span class="black">Maximoff is capable of using her energy in such an acute telekinetic
                    way that she is able to completely disintegrate objects, as she did with several Ultron Sentries
                    after sensing her brother's death.</span></li>
            <li>Force-Field Generation: <span class="black">Maximoff is able to create highly durable barriers of red
                    energy that she can shape and manipulate as needed.</span></li>
            <li>Telekinesis: <span class="black">Maximoff has the ability to move, levitate and otherwise manipulate
                    objects.</span></li>
            <li>Levitation: <span class="black">Maximoff is able to use this power to move through the air and simulate
                    flight, in order to hover and safely float back to the ground.</span></li>
            <li>Mental Manipulation: <span class="black">Maximoff was able to deploy a form of mental manipulation,
                    often as a type of illusory hypnosis, using the same neuro-electric interface that is the basis of
                    her telepathic powers.</span></li>
            <li>Chaos Magic: <span class="black">Able to harness Chaos Magic, Maximoff was the realization of the myth
                    of the Scarlet Witch, a being capable of spontaneous creation.</span></li>
